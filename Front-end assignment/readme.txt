Update the included HTML file and write a jQuery script that does the following upon clicking on the link:
-Make the sun fade in over a duration of two seconds
-Only after the sun is visible, make it fade out over two seconds, but wait half a second before this happens
-Only after the sun has faded out, give the input field focus

Write the script in such a way that the interactions don't break if the semantic CSS classes are changed.  The HTML can be modified.
