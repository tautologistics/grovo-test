			 * 	Instructions:
			 *	Please add the necessary event handlers for each anchor element as described in
			 *	the text it contains. Each event must create a POST request with a single
			 *	parameter to an endpoint which uses the activityModel class to process the data.
			 *	
			 *	The parameter's value must be a JSON object containing the event type
			 *	(click, mouse over, etc.) and the user id (an integer of your choice).
			 *	Send output to the browser's JavaScript console in case of success or error
			 *	with an appropriate message for each case.
			 *  
			 *  Note that the anchor tags will not point to a different URI. You may choose
			 *  to use an external library to add event handlers and create HTTP requests.
			 *
